# Natural-gas-Analysis
The united states is the worldâ€™s largest consumer and one of the largest producers of natural gas in 2019. So some research on natural gas is necessary.
So, natural gas is an important source for both electricity generation and Industrial production. I want to see the amount of natural gas used in Massachusetts and how it distributed to different customers.

# Visualize volume of natural gas delivered to consumers (residential, commercial, industrial, Vehicle Fuel, Electric Power) in Massachusetts from 2015 to 2019 and make some conclusions after analyzing.
First, I am curious about the amount of natural gas used in Massachusetts between 2015 to 2019. As we can see, volume of natural gas delivered to Electric Power in MA is decreasing from year to year, the possible reason behind is the rising of renewable energy powers such as solar, Wind or Hydropower.

Second, the volume of natural gas delivered to industrial in MA is much lower than that delivered to other consumers.

So I want to see if this scenario is common in other states.

There is a huge difference in volume of natural gas delivered to industry between two states

#1 reason: The differences in industry quantity
The quantity of industry in California is almost four times 
larger than that in Massachusetts.

#2 reason: The reliance on natural gas
The average natural gas annual consumption per industry 
in CA is almost 4 times higher than that in Ma.

# Visualize Average price of natural gas delivered to consumers (residential, commercial, industrial, Electric Power) in Massachusetts from 2015 to 2019 and make some conclusions after analyzing.
Average price of natural gas delivered to residential consumers is the highest.

Ma residential natural gas price is in the middle of The new England region.

Ma residential natural gas price is higher than US average price.
